# Steer-Point

Teaching during COVID has became difficult as teachers don't have proper tools to teach. It's difficult to use a whiteboard with mouse so to solve this problem I and my team mates devised a solution. That solution was building a smart white board which can be used using a blue object such as pen. And the best part is that it is deployed on a website so anyone can access it.

The features of this white board are:
1. User can write with the help of a virtual pen (blue-object).
2. User can write/draw with different colors like blue, red, green, etc.
3. User can clear the white board anytime.
4. The work which is done on the white board can be saved in the local PC.
